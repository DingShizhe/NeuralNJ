  C-T: 5.474
  G-T: 1.000

State frequencies: (user-defined)

  pi(A) = 0.222
  pi(C) = 0.265
  pi(G) = 0.179
  pi(T) = 0.334

Rate matrix Q:

  T   0.00218     0.735    0.0904    -0.827

Model of rate heterogeneity: Invar+Gamma with 4 categories
Proportion of invariable sites: 0.298
Gamma shape alpha: 0.866

 Category  Relative_rate  Proportion
  0         0              0.298
  1         0.156          0.176
  2         0.616          0.176
  3         1.39           0.176
  4         3.54           0.176
Relative rates are computed as MEAN of the portion of the Gamma distribution falling in the category.
